# Oregon Trail Linked List

### Purpose
This is a project given to me by Turing School of Software. I've been successful in created a linked list using two ruby classes that interact with eachother. This project taught me more about how to work with creating instances of Nodes and using the linked list class to manipulate these nodes into one long list. It includes functionality to insert nodes into the list, and to prepend the whole list by making a new head node with a given value. I'd say the main takeaway here is learning enough to tackle a binary search tree, which I plan on doing in the near future.
